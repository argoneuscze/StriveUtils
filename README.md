# StriveUtils

This is a tool that replaces the RISC gauge with Wall damage.

Wall damage on P2 shows on P1's RISC gauge to keep combos stable damage-wise.

It's still a very barebones prototype, but it should work. Effects in online play are unknown, but will probably lead to desyncs and/or crashes, as it directly writes into memory.

Use at your own risk.

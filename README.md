# StriveUtils

This is a tool that (for now) replaces the P2 RISC gauge with P2 Wall damage.

It's still a very barebones prototype, but it should work.

## How to use

- Download [.NET 5 runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-desktop-5.0.7-windows-x64-installer)
- Download the [latest release](https://github.com/argoneuscze/StriveUtils/releases/latest)
- Load up the game into practice mode
- Run the .exe
